# Amazon Purchase Script

# Use at your own risk.

This is a Python script that checks if an item is in stock, shipped by Amazon, and under a certain price limit. The script will then purchase the item with limited captcha solving abilities. 

Example: script to buy a PS5 on Amazon (Please do not use this script for scalping, this is simply a free open source solution for those that want a console but are unable to get one due to market competitiveness)

forked from yosh1/amazon-automation


Notes of caution: 
--- 

Things to check for on Amazon/potential edge cases: 

 * Amazon 2FA (an option is to disable but this will **expose your account to security problems**)
 * 1 Click buy sometimes does not work. Sometimes it does. 
 * **Behavior is dependent on your default shipping address and payment method. Use at your own risk**

Development: 
--- 
## TODO: 
Detect when Amazon sends to captcha by detecting for text on the captcha page. After detecting, call the `validate_captcha` function. 

Requirements: 
--- 
* Python 3 
* Python modules in `requirements.txt` 
* [WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) in same directory 

Recommended to be run on Linux or Max. Would be a good script to run on a raspberry pi or server

## Logic/Behavior: 
 
 1. Starts Selenium 
 2. Loops the following until all attributes of the item are correct: 
    1. Verifies item is in stock 
    2. Verifies the price is less than the set maximum
    3. Checks to make sure the shipper is from Amazon.com 
        
        *NOTE: I used shipper instead of seller because quite a few items are not actually sold by Amazon.* **Change this on a case by case basis**
4. Logs in 
5. Adds to cart 
6. Checks out
